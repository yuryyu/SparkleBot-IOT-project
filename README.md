SparkleBot is an IoT monitoring and management Cleaning system that uses MQTT for real-time communication, PyQt5 for a user-friendly GUI, and SQLite for logging device data like battery levels and relay errors. It tracks device statuses, displays alerts, and stores critical events for analysis, making it ideal for managing IoT devices efficiently.
